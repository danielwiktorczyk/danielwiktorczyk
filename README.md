### Hello there

Hi! I'm Daniel, and I'm a 4th year Co-op Software Engineering Student at Concordia University. 

I love games of all kinds, and have always wanted to find out how they were made. Lately, I've been persuing that, and am climbing the ropes and looking to make game development my future. 

I've done a few projects here and there, but I pinned the coolest ones if you would like to check them out.
